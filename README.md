# PandasEye

PandasEye consists of a set of tools developed for action prediction and affect recognition. 

## Getting started

## Built with
* Python 2.7
* Pandas 
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Scikit-learn
* Imblearn

## Prediction pipeline

#### Sequencing for action prediction
Scripts are in [parseFeatures](_scripts_preprocessing/parseFeatures).

| Parameters    | Description   | Example  |
| ------------- |-------------|-----|
| prefix        | right-aligned | 2 (2 fixations prior to the action) |
| suffix        | centered      | 2 (1 fixation after the action) |

### Example run

python main_new_featureExtraction_WTP.py


### Feature engineering for action prediction papers

### Feature engineering for affect recognition

### Data preprocessing

* 
# - feature scaling
# - imputing missing values
# - splitting to a training and testing set (stratified shuffling)
# - splitting to a training and testing set (person specified)
# - feature selection (percentile)
# - downsampling the majority class
# - upsampling the minority class


### Machine learning experiments

### Outcome measures
kFold crossvalidation and leaveOnePersonOut. - for each fold. Two last lines contains mean 
and standard deviation of following outcome measures. 
Each measure is calculated for training and testing folds.

| Measure | Description|
|-------------| --------------|
| [train/test]_ACC | Accuracy |
| [train/test]_AUC| Area under the ROC curve|
| [train/test]_kappa | Cohen's kappa| 
| [train/test]_positive_acc| Accuracy of positive class|
| [train/test]_negative_acc|Accuracy of negative class|
| [train/test]_f1 | F1-measure|
| [train/test]_precision| |
| [train/test]_recall| |
|no_rows| Number of rows|
|no_features| Number of features|
|no_testingSamples| Number of samples in the testing fold|
|no_positiveTest| Number of samples in the positive class (testing fold)|
|no_negativeTest| Number of samples in the negative class (testing fold)|

## Example run

python PandasEye/PredictionPipeline/3_ml_classify_loocv_longterm_RF.py

-i ExampleData/features_longterm_last5min_stats_omitShort_ValenceArousal_npNan.csv

-o Results/

-m "HOT arousal: last 5 minutes - RandomGridSearch"

-d "HOT_LAST_SMOTE"
