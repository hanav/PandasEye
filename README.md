# PandasEye

PandasEye consists of a set of tools developed for action prediction and affect recognition. 

## Getting started

## Prerequisities

## Built with
* Python 2.7
* Pandas 
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

## Prediction pipeline

### Data preprocessing

#### Sequencing for action prediction
Scripts are in [parseFeatures](_scripts_preprocessing/parseFeatures).

| Parameters    | Description   | Example  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| prefix        | right-aligned | 2 (2 fixations prior to the action) |
| suffix        | centered      | 2 (1 fixation after the action) |
